# Welcome

Hi and welcome to my project. POSHTML5 was created in his first version a few years ago has "Powershell Web Framework". That's why all functions of POSHTML5 starts with "PWF".
*The goal* of this project is to create a simple and fast tool to create awesome reporting, with last HTML5 technologies.
I try to regulary update and fix issues.

**No CSS, JS source files required. Functions use CDN files link.**

*Compatible with all web browsers*

# What to know ?
The framework has been optimized to be easily used.
All the functions are commented.
All arguments for each of them are explained.
The most interesting is that (almost) all functions are concatainable.
All functions were having a Content argument can contain some other functions and code.

**This doc will be auto-updated when a new function will be available**
